peaked at input fastQ files to see which was the index vs read based on seq length
Filename	Contents	Readcount
1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz	Read1	
1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz	Index1
1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz	Index2
1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz	Read2
Have to calculate # of reads for input into mean calculator
got wc -l for read files, took forever 
1452986940 / 4 = 363,246,735

drafted python script to calculate mean qscores at each position
adapted from ps9

Made a slurm script
when working with gzip.open, the normal 'r' mode returns binary. have to use 'tr' to get actual values
had to specify 'python' before the filename in my slurm script
I realized that hardcoding the qscores list length isn't good for the index reads, made it dynamically calculate
list length based on length of 1st qscore line encountered. I also made it dynamically calculate total number of records
for more broad applicability
