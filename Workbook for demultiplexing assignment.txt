peaked at input fastQ files to see which was the index vs read based on seq length
Filename	Contents	Readcount
1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz	Read1	
1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz	Index1
1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz	Index2
1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz	Read2
Have to calculate # of reads for input into mean calculator
got wc -l for read files, took forever 
1452986940 / 4 = 363,246,735

drafted python script to calculate mean qscores at each position
adapted from ps9

7-30-20

Made a slurm script
when working with gzip.open, the normal 'r' mode returns binary. have to use 'tr' to get actual values
had to specify 'python' before the filename in my slurm script
I realized that hardcoding the qscores list length isn't good for the index reads, made it dynamically calculate
list length based on length of 1st qscore line encountered. I also made it dynamically calculate total number of records
for more broad applicability

finished read1. Runtime stats:

unix command for test files
python demultiplexing.py -f /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-input_FASTQ/ -x /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-input_FASTQ/indexes.txt -o /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-output_FASTQ/

Unit tests:
passed in actual index file. 24 indices in file. 
Expecting 24 indices read (ignoring top column)
got 24 indices in list

making permutations
Expecting 576 permutations of those indices
ran test, the dictionary of permutations had 576 elements :)

open input files returns dictionary with 4 items, one for each input file

8/4/20

output file opener should open 52 files, 2 for each index, 2 for mismatched, and 2 for unknown reads.
52 files are in the test output folder

passed in 4 reads with Ns in indices, evaluate_reads correctly identified them as 'unknown'
a read with really poor qscores was identified as 'unknown'

8/5/20
made new argparse to accept directions to each input file, not just the parent directory
added runtime option for output file format
new command for testing
python demultiplexing.py -r /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-input_FASTQ/test_R1.fastq.gz -R /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-input_FASTQ/test_R4.fastq.gz -i /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-input_FASTQ/test_R2.fastq.gz -I /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-input_FASTQ/test_R3.fastq.gz -x /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-input_FASTQ/indexes.txt -o /projects/bgmp/dgratz/bioinfo/Bi622/demultiplexing/demultiplexing-derrik-gratz/TEST-output_FASTQ/ -f test_out
need to check that program is getting reverse compliment of reads
input :
        index 1 = ACTTCGAC
        qscore  = AAA<FJJJ
        index 2 = GTCGAAGT                                                                            +
        qscore 2= AAAAAJJF
expected output:
        evaluate_reads returns 'paired'
        since indices aren't in the index file, they should get put in the undetermined files
performing as expected
